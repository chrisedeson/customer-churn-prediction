## Quick Start

```bash
./setup.sh          # Setup virtual environment and install dependencies
source venv/bin/activate
make data           # Download and prepare data
make train          # Train models
make run            # Start Streamlit app
```

## Deployment

Live app: [URL will be added after deployment]

## Models

- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost

Performance: AUC-ROC 0.80-0.85, Recall 60%+

## CLV Assumptions

Expected Tenure = 24 months for non-churners, 6 months for churners
CLV = MonthlyCharges Ã— ExpectedTenure
