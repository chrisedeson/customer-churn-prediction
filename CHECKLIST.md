- [x] requirements.txt with pinned versions
- [x] Makefile for automation
- [x] Modular src/ directory (config, data_prep, clv_analysis, train_models, interpretability, predict)
- [x] app.py (Streamlit application)
- [x] data/raw/ and data/processed/
- [x] models/ directory
- [x] Git repository initialized with meaningful commits

### Code Quality
